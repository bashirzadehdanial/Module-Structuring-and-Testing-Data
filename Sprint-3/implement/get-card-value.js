// This problem involves playing cards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck

// You will need to implement a function getCardValue

// You need to write assertions for your function to check it works in different cases

// Acceptance criteria:

// Given a card string in the format "Aâ™ " (representing a card in blackjack - the last character will always be an emoji for a suit, and all characters before will be a number 2-10, or one letter of J, Q, K, A),
// When the function getCardValue is called with this card string as input,
// Then it should return the numerical card value

// Handle Number Cards (2-10):
// Given a card with a rank between "2" and "9",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the numeric value corresponding to the rank (e.g., "5" should return 5).

// Handle Face Cards (J, Q, K):
// Given a card with a rank of "10," "J," "Q," or "K",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the value 10, as these cards are worth 10 points each in blackjack.

// Handle Ace (A):
// Given a card with a rank of "A",
// When the function is called with an Ace,
// Then it should, by default, assume the Ace is worth 11 points, which is a common rule in blackjack.

// Handle Invalid Cards:
// Given a card with an invalid rank (neither a number nor a recognized face card),
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should throw an error indicating "Invalid card rank."


function getCardValue(card) {
  let rank;
  if (card.length === 1 && card >= "2" && card <= "9") {
    return parseInt(card);
    
  }
  if (card.length == 2){
    if(card == "10"){
      return card
    }
    if (rank === "A") {
        return 11;
      }
      else{
            rank = card.slice(0, -1);

             if (rank === "J" || rank === "Q" || rank === "K") {
              return 10;
            }
       

  } 
  throw new Error("Invalid card rank");
}
}

module.exports = {getCardValue}
